## Current To-dos

- [x] | high | hitl-1  | Setup `.github/` folder. ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] | high | hitl-14 | Improve MCP Server UI/UX
   1. | high | hitl-15 | Improve the tkinter GUI for better user experience while maintaining human-in-the-loop capability. Focus on MCP server improvements, not VS Code extension.
      - The tkinter approach is correct for human-in-the-loop interruption of AI workflows via MCP protocol.
- [x] | priority | hitl-2  | Create workspace structure ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] | priority | hitl-3  | Define repo structure ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] | priority | hitl-4  | Refactor codebase
  All docs must be in their proper `docs/` folder, and if there isn't update.
  - [x] | priority | hitl-4-1 |  Create a clear doc of what the project is currently about, its capabilities, limitations and complexity ✅ COMPLETED
  - | priority | hitl-4-2 |  Define project scope
    - Add each ToT to `docs/ToT/{}.md`
    - For each ToT, break down into smaller tasks and prioritize them based on impact and effort
    - Create a roadmap with milestones and deadlines (use story points)
    - Regularly review and adjust the roadmap as needed

      use #actor-critic-thinking to help you create the ToT with more detailed insights. Remember you can use tools in between the mcp calls (e.g. #think, #websearch, #any-other available tool, prefer the ones with bulk actions) to help you with the task.
