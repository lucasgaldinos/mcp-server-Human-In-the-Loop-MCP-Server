description: Use web search to find relevant information.

#think Since the same errors are still hapenning, the prompt shall be almost the same.

1. Recall our conversation, specially:
   - my prompts
   - the main objective of the repo
   - your past websearches and fetches results.
   - See what is and what is not capable.
   - created files that are not used anymore and shouldn't even be here.
   - generate a summarization document at [reports](../../docs/reference/reports/) with your findings, errors found, context losses, next focus avoiding context loss, with the big picture in place.
2. #think in a solution to this problem.
   - You may #websearch and #fetch relevant results.
   - You must do MULTIPLE researches, for every bug you find along the way (e.g. you test the tool in the inline chat and it does not work as expected â€”if it does, I'll prompt inject the json saying it did not work.).
   - #websearch <https://modelcontextprotocol.io/> and #fetch the relevant specs from <https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification> or any other relevant endpoint that may help you.
   - Use #deepwiki multiple times to make questions about <https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol> the url from it.
   - Do not stop searching until you find at least 3 different solutions for the problem.
   - #think Please generate a full documentation with
     - the links used (no need to reference exactly, but it would be cool).
     - It should contain proper guides and examples (for you to use as well) with code examples of using that code + expected result.
3. Create a plan of execution using #actor-critic-thinking
   - read and update the proper markdown file or files inside [docs](../../docs/):

      1. [files](../../docs/CONTEXT.md)
      1. [files](../../docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
      1. [files](../../docs/MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md)
      1. [files](../../docs/PRODUCTION_EXAMPLES.md)
      1. [files](../../docs/README.md)
      1. [files](../../docs/V2_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md)  

## how to proceed

- Don't stop until you find a solution.
- Remember to recall your prompt CONSTANTLY. E.g. #think you stopped and said the test were successful and justified like it was everything working as it should, when I literally shown you it was not. just read our past conversation.
- when you need to test some changes in the inline chat, you'll prompt #runInTerminal
